## Background

This project folder details a project where I showed that the randomness of rainfall on Easter Island could promote the evolution of cooperation. However, that project is predicated on the assumption that rainfall is actually random. Here, I test whether rainfall is random in the strict sense that I use in the modeling project as well as the more general sense. In the model, rainfall was treated as a binary, discrete variable that could either be random where run times are drawn from an exponential distribution) or periodic (run times are drawn from a truncated exponential distribution where higher levels of periodicity determine tighter truncations of the distribution).
